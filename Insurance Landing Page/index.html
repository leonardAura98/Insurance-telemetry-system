            <h1> What is car insurance?</h1>
            <h2>Answer</h2>
            <p>Car insurance is a contract between a vehicle owner and an insurance company that
              provides financial protection against physical damage or bodily injury resulting from traffic
              collisions and against liability that could also arise from incidents involving the vehicle.</p>

            <h1> How does car insurance work?</h1>
            <h2>Answer</h2>
            <p>When you purchase car insurance, you pay a premium to the insurer. In return, the insurer
              agrees to cover certain costs associated with accidents or damages as specified in your
              policy. If you file a claim, the insurer assesses the situation and compensates you or the
              other party according to the terms of your policy</p>

            <h1>Why do you need car insurance?</h1>
            <h2>Answer</h2>
            <p>If you own a car, you need auto insurance. A car insurance policy helps provide financial protection for you, and possibly for others if you're involved in an accident. All it takes is a few minutes to get a personalized car insurance quote with great rates, discounts, and options available to you.</p>

            <h1>What is the difference between comprehensive and third-party insurance?</h1>
            <h2>Answer</h2>
            <p>-Comprehensive Insurance: Covers damage to your vehicle from various risks including
              theft, fire, and natural disasters.
              -Third-Party Insurance: Legally required in many places, it covers damages to others'
              vehicles and medical expenses if you are at fault in an accident but does not cover your own
              vehicle's damages</p>

            <h1> Should I make small claims?</h1>
            <h2>Answer</h2>
            <p>It's generally advisable to avoid making small claims as they can lead to increased premiums
              when you renew your policy. Assess whether the cost of repairs justifies filing a claim based
              on potential premium hikes</p>
